# 🔑 Getting Your API Key

On signup, every user is automatically assigned a unique API key, which can easily be accessible from the Dashboard. The steps have been outlined below:

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Security**: API keys are expected to be kept securely. If for any circumstance you suspect any case of key theft, simply [regenerate a new key](regenerate-api-key.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Authorization](./) on how to use the API keys.
{% endhint %}
