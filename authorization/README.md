# üîê Authorization

All of the translation APIs are secured by default, and hence required you to specify an API key along with each request.

This authorization scheme leverages on the API token scheme, which specifies including the token in the `Authorization` field of the request header.

The format is**`Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}`**.

Check [example](../money-translation/money-translate-to-sentence/#sample-api-request) for a request requiring authorization.
